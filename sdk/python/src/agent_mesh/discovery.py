"""The mesh's directory as a member uses it, as agentmesh-node does
(internal/node/directory_client.go): the member keeps no DHT and asks the
routers it holds over /mesh/directory/1.0.0, one DirectoryRequest per
stream, one DirectoryResponse back. A request goes to one held router and
to the next when it fails. The routers run the lookup across their own DHT.
A key is the sha256 multihash of "mesh:service:<type>[:<name>]" for a
service and of "mesh:peer:<peer_id>" for a member."""
