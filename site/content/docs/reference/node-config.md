`sam-node.yaml` declares what a node is (labels), what it publishes
(services), what it requires from callers (attenuation) and what it requires
from providers (egress). Both `sam-node join` and `sam-node run` read it from
`--config`, by default `./sam-node.yaml`. A missing file means an empty
configuration. Unknown keys are an error, because a typo under `attenuation`
would otherwise weaken the node without notice.

```yaml
version: "v1alpha1"

labels:
  region: eu-west-1
  team: platform

services:
  - type: mcp
    name: code-reviewer
    description: "Reviews diffs"
    target_url: "http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp"
  - type: mcp
    name: filesystem
    command: ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/srv/docs"]
    env:
      NODE_OPTIONS: "--max-old-space-size=256"
  - type: inference
    name: vllm
    target_url: "http://127.0.0.1:8000"
    target_auth_path: /etc/sam/vllm-key
  - type: a2a
    name: triage
    target_url: "http://127.0.0.1:9999"

attenuation:
  rules:
    - 'maintenance() <- time($t), $t > 2026-12-31T00:00:00Z;'
  checks:
    - 'check if label("team", "platform");'
  policies:
    - 'deny if service("mcp", "filesystem"), group("contractors");'
    - 'deny if maintenance();'

egress:
  require_labels:
    jurisdiction: eu
```

## `version`

`"v1alpha1"`, or omitted (read as `v1alpha1`). A node refuses a version it
does not know.

## `labels`

A map of `key: value`. Keys are 1 to 63 characters from `[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]`.
Values are non-empty, at most 255 characters, and contain no `,`, `=` or
control characters, because the wire form is a comma-separated `key=value`
list. A malformed label stops the node at start.

Labels are sent at enrollment. The control plane writes them into the node's
credential as `label(key, value)` facts, but only if a role the node holds
allows them through `allowed_labels`. A label that the role does not permit
fails the enrollment. Changing labels requires a new enrollment. Matching is
exact and case-sensitive.

## `services`

A list. Each entry has these keys:

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | yes | `mcp`, `inference` or `a2a`. `egress` is refused here: a destination outside the mesh is assigned to nodes by the control plane, in the [egress section](../policy/#egress-destinations) of the mesh policy. |
| `name` | yes | Unique on this node. DNS-style labels separated by dots (`db-reader`, `build.runner`). Policy grants refer to `type://name`. |
| `description` | no | Shown in discovery results and in the console. |
| `target_url` | `mcp`: this or `command`; `inference` and `a2a`: yes | Backend URL that the node proxies to. Embedded credentials (`http://user:pass@`) are refused. |
| `command` | `mcp` only: this or `target_url` | Argument vector of a subprocess that speaks MCP over stdio. The node starts and supervises it. |
| `env` | no | `command` only. Environment for the subprocess. |
| `target_auth_path` | no | `target_url` only. File whose contents the node presents to the backend: a bare token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, or `user:pass` as HTTP Basic. Read once at start, never logged or advertised. It overrides any `Authorization` header that a caller sent. |

Rules by type:

- **`mcp`**: `command` or `target_url`, not both. A `target_url` must be a
  Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint.
- **`inference`**: `target_url` only. It must be the root URL of the backend
  without `/v1`. The node adds the prefix. Callers reach the service through
  the node's `/v1` endpoint or at `/sam/<peer>/inference/<name>/v1/...`.
- **`a2a`**: `target_url` only. The agent card is fetched from
  `/.well-known/agent-card.json` on the backend and served again with mesh
  URLs. The card must use the A2A 1.0 format.

Before a service is advertised, the node probes the backend
(`--backend-probe-timeout`, 2 seconds). A backend that does not answer is
not advertised, and the log records this.

Services exist only through this file and through the control plane's
egress assignments. There is no runtime API that adds a service. An agent
with access to the node's API therefore cannot point the mesh at a new
backend.

## `attenuation`

Biscuit Datalog that the node adds to every authorization decision for
requests it receives. Each entry is one statement. A trailing `;` is
optional. A statement that does not parse stops the node at start.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rules` | Derive new facts from existing ones: `head(...) <- body(...)`. |
| `checks` | Conditions that must all hold: `check if ...`. A failing check denies the request regardless of any policy. |
| `policies` | `allow if ...` and `deny if ...`, evaluated before the baseline policies. The first matching policy wins. A `deny` here overrides a mesh grant. An `allow` here admits a caller that the mesh did not grant, but never a caller that fails a check. |

Facts available:

| Fact | Source |
|---|---|
| `service($type, $name)` | The request: which service is being called. |
| `time($now)` | Injected at evaluation. |
| `connection_peer_id($id)` | The authenticated peer. |
| `user($sub)`, `email($e)`, `group($g)`, `idp_role($r)` | The caller's OIDC claims, from its credential. |
| `role($r)` | The caller's mesh roles. |
| `label($k, $v)` | The caller's attested labels. |
| `node($id)`, `client_peer_id($id)`, `expiration($t)` | The caller's credential binding and expiry. |
| `granted_service_*`, `granted_target_*`, `granted_agent_*` | The caller's grants. |
| `target_fact($name, $value)` | This node's own identity facts, for target matching. |
| `agent($id)` | The agent the caller says it acts for, when present. |
| `method($m)`, `path($p)` | The request, when it is HTTP: the method as received and the path as the backend sees it. On a tunnel, `CONNECT` and an empty path. Absent on a stream that carries no HTTP request. |
| `host($h)`, `port($n)` | The destination of a request for an egress destination. |

The dialect has no `!=`; write a negation with `!`, as in
`deny if method($m), !($m == "GET")`.

The mobile app has the same three lists in its settings, with the same
syntax and the same errors.

## `egress`

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `require_labels` | A map of `key: value`. Every remote provider that this node sends a request to must have all of these labels attested in its credential, whether or not the caller asked for labels. Same syntax rules as `labels`. |

This is the operator's floor. A caller's `X-Sam-Required-Labels` header is
checked separately. It can add requirements but cannot remove or relax the
floor. A floor that names a label which no provider carries makes the node
unable to reach any provider, which can serve as an egress kill switch. Omit
the block for no floor.

## Kubernetes

The `sam-node` Helm chart renders its `config:` value as this file and
restarts the pod when it changes. Because the backend runs in the same pod,
`target_url` there is always `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`.
