Agent Mesh Connect currently supports Android only. There is no iOS app.
The app is tested in CI on an Android emulator. Its screens, the on-device
tools it exposes and the FFI surface may change.
{{% /alert %}}

Agent Mesh Connect is a Flutter app that runs `agentmesh-node` on an Android phone. The Go node is
compiled into a shared library and driven over Dart FFI. The app is the UI
around it, plus a small MCP server that exposes the phone's sensors to the
mesh. A phone enrolled this way is a node like any other. It has a key, a
credential and a peer ID, and it appears in discovery with its
`phone-sensors` service.

## Android tester tutorial

You need an Android 10 or newer phone and an internet connection. You can
join a public testnet through browser login, or join your own `agentmesh-one`
mesh by scanning its QR code. Choose one enrollment path, then follow the
same connection checks.

Keep **Location** off throughout this tutorial, and leave external MCP
bridging unconfigured. Other participants may be able to call services you
expose. The public testnets have no uptime commitment. A new `agentmesh-one`
mesh uses an open development policy that lets enrolled nodes call each
other's services. Share enrollment codes only with people you intend to
admit.

### 1. Install the test build

1. Open the Google Play testing invitation supplied by the test coordinator.
  Use the invited Google account, join the test, and install or update
  **Agent Mesh Connect**. If you were given an APK instead, download it from the
  supplied build link and open it on the phone. Android may ask you to
  allow installation from that source.
2. Check that you have the build requested in the invitation. Record its
  version and build number, along with your phone model and Android
  version. The coordinator can identify the build number from the APK
  link if Android's app information only shows the version name.
3. Open **Agent Mesh Connect**. A new installation shows **Welcome to Agent Mesh**.
  If you already see the dashboard, the app has a saved enrollment. Keep
  it for an upgrade test, or use step 7 to change meshes.

Use the same installation source for updates. If Android rejects an APK
update because its signature differs from the installed app, report it to
the coordinator. Uninstalling or clearing app storage deletes the saved
identity and settings.

{{< figure src="../../../images/agentmesh-connect-welcome.png" alt="Agent Mesh Connect welcome screen with Scan enrollment code and Enter details manually buttons" caption="The welcome screen offers both paths: Enter details manually for a public testnet, or Scan enrollment code for your own mesh." width="320" >}}

### 2. Choose your mesh

| Option | What you need | Enrollment path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public testnet | A Google or GitHub account and a browser. You do not need to run a server. | [Option A: Public testnet](#option-a-public-testnet) |
| Your own mesh | A computer running `agentmesh-one`, or a QR code from a trusted operator who runs it. No Google or GitHub login is needed for enrollment. | [Option B: Your own mesh with a QR code](#option-b-your-own-mesh-with-a-qr-code) |

For the public-testnet option, choose one of these URLs:

| Testnet | Control plane URL | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bananas | `https://bananas.sam-mesh.dev` | Recommended for testing current development code. Its servers follow `main`. |
| Hub | `https://hub.sam-mesh.dev` | Compare against servers running the latest release. |

See [Testnets](../../contributing/testnets/) for their access policy and
availability details. For your own mesh, use the HTTPS URL printed by
`agentmesh-one`, as described in option B.

Record the control plane URL you use. It is not an app download link.
The dashboard currently shows **Mesh: public-mesh** for either enrollment
path, so that label does not identify the server you joined.

### 3. Enroll

1. On **Services**, check that **Battery Status** and **Location** are off.
2. For a fresh test, leave **Config** unchanged. Labels and the **Rules**,
  **Policies**, and **Checks** fields should be empty. If this is an
  upgrade test with existing settings, record those settings before
  changing anything.

Then follow option A or option B.

#### Option A: Public testnet

1. Return to **Dashboard** and tap **Enter details manually**.
2. Enter your chosen testnet URL in **Control plane URL**, including `https://`.
3. Leave **Enrollment token** empty. Public-testnet browser login does not
  require a token or QR code.
4. Tap **Login & Enroll (Browser)**. Complete the Google or GitHub sign-in
  offered by `auth.sam-mesh.dev` in the browser on this phone.
5. When the browser shows **Authorization successful!**, return to Agent Mesh
  Connect using the app switcher. Keep the app open while enrollment
  finishes. The browser message only confirms the login callback.

{{< figure src="../../../images/agentmesh-connect-public-login.png" alt="Cropped manual enrollment form with the Bananas control plane URL, an empty Enrollment token field, and Login and Enroll Browser button" caption="Public-testnet enrollment (cropped view). Enter your chosen testnet URL, leave Enrollment token empty, and use Login & Enroll (Browser)." width="420" >}}

If you need to sign in on another device, choose **Device Login (TV / Other
Device)** instead. Open the displayed verification URL on that device,
enter the code shown by the app, and complete sign-in. Keep Agent Mesh Connect
open while it waits for approval. Treat the verification URL and code as
private login information.

Once the dashboard appears, continue to step 4.

#### Option B: Your own mesh with a QR code

The [Your own mesh guide](../../getting-started/your-own-mesh/#reaching-it-from-other-machines)
covers running `agentmesh-one` and reaching it from a phone. For this enrollment
test, you only need the server and its QR code. You can skip that guide's
model-serving steps.

Use this command to start the mesh and print its enrollment QR code:

```bash
agentmesh-one --data-dir ~/agentmesh-one --tunnel cloudflare --enroll-qr
```

1. On your computer, install `agentmesh-one` using the
   [installation instructions](../../getting-started/quickstart/#1-install).
   If a trusted operator already has a mesh running, ask them for an
   enrollment code and its expected hostname, then continue at item 4.
2. Run the command above in a terminal on the computer.
3. If prompted, approve the download of `cloudflared`. Wait for the HTTPS
   API URL and enrollment QR code in the terminal. The tunnel provides a
   temporary `trycloudflare.com` address without requiring a Cloudflare
   account. Keep `agentmesh-one` running and the computer awake during the test.

4. On the phone, return to **Dashboard** and tap **Scan enrollment code**.
   Allow camera access when asked and scan the code from the computer's
   screen.
5. In **Join this mesh?**, check that **Control plane** matches the HTTPS
   hostname in the terminal or the one supplied by your operator. Tap
   **Join** only if it matches.
6. Keep the app open until the dashboard appears, then continue to step 4
   of the tutorial. This enrollment path does not open Google or GitHub
   login.

The following output was captured from a temporary `agentmesh-one` instance.
Its QR token successfully enrolled a test node and was consumed. The server
and tunnel were then stopped and their state deleted. Token values and the
temporary directory path are redacted below. Use the URL and QR code from
your own terminal, not this example.

mesh://enroll?server=https%3A%2F%2Fused-encryption-assumptions-miller.trycloudflare.com&token=[redacted]
Token ID: 2542ac5fa60e (revoke early with: agentmesh-one token revoke 2542ac5fa60e)
```

{{< figure src="../../../images/agentmesh-connect-join.png" alt="Join this mesh confirmation dialog showing a control plane hostname and Cancel and Join buttons" caption="After scanning, check the control plane hostname before tapping Join. This screenshot shows an example tunnel address and the app's shortened token hint; your values will differ." width="320" >}}

The phone must be able to reach the HTTPS address. A computer's
`http://127.0.0.1` address refers to the phone itself when used on the phone,
and remote plaintext HTTP URLs are not accepted. An existing HTTPS reverse
proxy can be used instead of the temporary tunnel, as described in
[Your own mesh](../../getting-started/your-own-mesh/#reaching-it-from-other-machines).

The startup QR code admits one device by default. For another device, or
when a code has expired or been used, keep the server running and generate
a fresh code in another terminal. Replace the example hostname with the
HTTPS API hostname from the server's banner:

```bash
agentmesh-one token qr --data-dir ~/agentmesh-one \
  --server https://YOUR-HOSTNAME.trycloudflare.com
```

If scanning is unavailable, paste the complete `mesh://enroll?...` link
from the operator into **Enrollment token** under **Enter details
manually**. Check the populated **Control plane URL**, then tap **Join
with token**. The link contains a credential. Keep it and the QR code out
of screenshots and public reports. A temporary tunnel URL can change when
the server restarts, so use its current banner and record any restart
during testing.

#### Check enrollment

For either path, enrollment passes when the app switches to the dashboard
with **Start** and **Stop** controls. The node may still show **Node is
Stopped** until you start it. If the screen does not change after a minute,
or shows an error, record the status text before retrying.

### 4. Start and check the connection

1. Tap **Start** on **Dashboard**. If Android asks to allow notifications,
  allow them so you can see the background-service notification. Location
  permission is not needed. Camera access is only needed for QR scanning.
2. Allow up to a minute for the connection to settle.
3. Check that the dashboard says **Node is Running**, **Node ID** contains
  an identifier, and **Connected Peers** is greater than zero.
4. Record the **Node ID**, **Connected Peers**, and **DHT Size** values.
  Peer counts can change. A particular DHT size is not a pass criterion.

**Node is Running** alone does not prove a mesh connection. Report a peer
count that remains zero, even if the app shows no error.

{{< figure src="../../../images/agentmesh-connect-running.png" alt="Agent Mesh Connect dashboard showing Node is Running, one connected peer, DHT size one, and a Node ID" caption="A connected node shows Node is Running, a Node ID, and at least one Connected Peer. Your Node ID and peer counts will differ from this example." width="320" >}}

### 5. Check restart and reconnection

1. Tap **Stop**. Confirm **Node is Stopped**, then tap **Start** again.
  Check that peers reconnect and **Node ID** is unchanged.
2. With the node running, lock the phone for one minute. Unlock it and
  return to Agent Mesh Connect. Check the running state and peer count. Record
  any stop, crash, or failure to reconnect.
3. If mobile data is available, switch from Wi-Fi to mobile data while the
  node is running, then switch back. Allow up to a minute after each
  change and record whether peers reconnect without a manual restart.
  Note whether a VPN or Private DNS is enabled, without changing those
  settings for the initial test. For your own mesh, keep the server and
  tunnel running. If its HTTPS address is only reachable on your local
  network, skip the mobile-data check and note that limitation.
4. Tap **Stop**, close and reopen the app, then tap **Start**. Confirm it
  kept its enrollment and **Node ID** without asking you to sign in again.

If a check fails, capture the result before trying **Stop** and **Start**
as a recovery step. Report whether that recovery worked. These checks
should not require unenrollment or a device identity reset.

### 6. Optionally test battery sharing

This step shares your battery level and charging state with permitted mesh
participants. Skip it if you only want to test enrollment and connectivity.

1. While the node is running, open **Services** and enable **Battery Status**.
  Keep **Location** off.
2. Give the test coordinator your **Node ID** and control plane URL. Ask them to
  call `get_battery_status` on your `phone-sensors` service from another
  node on the same mesh, as described below in
  [Calling the phone from elsewhere](#calling-the-phone-from-elsewhere).
3. Compare the returned battery level and charging state with the phone.
4. Turn **Battery Status** off and ask for a new call. It should no longer
  return battery data. Record any permission denial or routing error
  separately from an incorrect sensor result.

The connection checks in steps 3-5 can pass without this remote tool test.
A successful remote call also verifies that another node can reach the
phone's service.

### 7. Finish or switch meshes

1. Turn off any service sharing you enabled and tap **Stop** when finished.
  You can keep the enrollment for the next test build.
2. To test another mesh, record your current **Node ID**, then tap
  **Unenroll / Clear Identity**. In the confirmation dialog, choose
  **Unenroll**. This removes the enrollment credentials and keeps the
  device's peer ID.
3. Repeat steps 2-5 using the other mesh's browser-login or QR path. Record
  the results for each mesh separately. For a QR enrollment, obtain a
  fresh code rather than reusing one that has already admitted a device.

**Reset device identity** also deletes the device key and local settings.
Use it only when the coordinator explicitly asks for a fresh-identity test.

### Troubleshooting and reports

| Symptom | What to check or report |
| --- | --- |
| The testnet URL shows `404` in a browser | The root page is not a health check. Enter the URL in the app. Check the [testnet health workflow](https://github.com/google/agentmesh/actions/workflows/testnet-health.yaml) for service incidents. |
| Login finishes but the app stays on enrollment | Return to the app on the same phone. Report the full status text and whether the browser showed the success message. |
| No enrollment QR appears | Check that `agentmesh-one` printed an HTTPS API URL and is running in an interactive terminal. You can generate a code with `agentmesh-one token qr` using that HTTPS URL. |
| A QR code or enrollment link is rejected | Confirm it is an Agent Mesh enrollment code from your operator and points to the expected HTTPS hostname. Request a fresh code if it expired or has already been used. |
| Your own mesh is unreachable | Check that the computer is awake and `agentmesh-one` and its tunnel are still running. Compare the recorded URL with the current banner. |
| `no good addresses` or `[::1]:53` | Report the app build and testnet. These were symptoms of the Android DNS bootstrap bug; confirm you installed the requested fixed build. |
| Enrollment is denied | Record the denial text and any configured labels. Do not paste a login token into the enrollment-token field. |
| Peers remain at zero or disappear after a network change | Report the network type, VPN/Private DNS state, and whether a manual stop/start recovers. |
| A tool call is denied | Record the tool name, mesh, and error. Access policy and the phone's sharing settings can both deny a call. |

Send the following report to the test coordinator or the issue linked in
your test invitation. For a failure, include a screenshot of the app's
status and the approximate time with time zone.

```text
App version and build number:
Installation source or build link:
Phone model and Android version:
Mesh (Bananas, Hub, or your own agentmesh-one):
Control plane URL:
agentmesh-one version and tunnel/proxy type (if applicable):

```

Remove API tokens, enrollment links or QR codes, verification codes, browser
callback URLs, account details, and location data from screenshots and
reports. You do not need to share the **Local API Token** for these tests.

## Configuration

The Config tab holds what `agentmesh-node.yaml` holds on a desktop: labels
(comma-separated `key=value`) and the attenuation rules, policies and checks
(one Datalog statement per line, with the same syntax and the same errors as
the file). Labels are attested at enrollment, so changing them requires
pressing **Re-enroll to apply**. Browser-enrolled nodes can use the saved
login session to re-enroll while keeping their peer ID. Token-enrolled
nodes must unenroll and join again to change labels. The tab also shows the
API token that protects the node's local API on the phone.

On Android 16 the app also registers two AppFunctions, `getMeshStatus` and
`callRemoteMeshTool`, so an on-device assistant can use the mesh without the
app in the foreground.

## Calling the phone from elsewhere

From any enrolled node, the phone is a peer with an MCP service:

```bash
mcp-client -url "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mesh/<phone-peer-id>/mcp/phone-sensors" -token "$TOKEN" -list
mcp-client -url "http://127.0.0.1:8080/mesh/<phone-peer-id>/mcp/phone-sensors" -token "$TOKEN" -tool get_battery_status
```

```json
{"battery_level": 64, "charging": true}
```

An agent finds the phone in the usual way. `find_remote_tools` lists
`mcp://phone-sensors/get_location`, `describe_remote_tool` shows that it
takes no arguments, and `call_remote_tool` returns
`{"latitude": ..., "longitude": ...}`. The policy on the control plane
decides who may call it. The phone's own attenuation rules can narrow that
further.

## How it is built

```text
Flutter app (mobile/agentmesh-node-app)
  lib/main.dart            the UI; talks to the node's local API over 127.0.0.1
  lib/agentmesh_ffi.dart   Dart FFI wrapper
        │ C calls
Go FFI library (mobile/agentmesh-node-ffi)
  StartNode, StopNode, EnrollNode, EnrollNodeBootstrap, ReEnrollNode,
  UnenrollNode, IsEnrolled, GetNodeID, GetMeshInfo, CallRemoteTool, ...
        │
agentmesh-node (internal/node), unchanged
```

The FFI package is a thin export layer over the same node code that the CLI
uses, including `CompleteNodeConfig` for labels and attenuation, so both
agree on validation. Lifecycle operations go over FFI. Everything else the
UI does (listing peers, toggling services) goes over HTTP to the node's
loopback API with a token generated at each launch.

Make targets:

| Target | Output |
| --- | --- |
| `make mobile-ffi-host` | `bin/libagentmesh.so` for the build host, for desktop tests of the FFI. |
| `make mobile-ffi-android` | `bin/android/libagentmesh.so` (arm64-v8a). |
| `make mobile-ffi-android-x86_64` | `bin/android-x86_64/libagentmesh.so`, for x86_64 emulators. Emulators on Apple Silicon run arm64 images and use the previous target. |
| `make mobile-app-apk` | The FFI library copied into `jniLibs/` and a release APK. `mobile-app-apk-emulator` and `mobile-app-bundle` are the emulator and Play Store variants. |

For an edit-run loop on a device:

```bash
make mobile-ffi-android
mkdir -p mobile/agentmesh-node-app/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a
cp bin/android/libagentmesh.so mobile/agentmesh-node-app/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/
cd mobile/agentmesh-node-app && flutter run
```

Release builds read signing material from `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH`,
`ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`,
and Firebase configuration from `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` or its base64 form.
`mobile/agentmesh-node-app/README.md` covers the toolchain setup.

## Testing

`mobile/mobile_e2e.sh` runs the end-to-end check that CI uses. It starts a
mock identity provider, a control plane, a router and a host node with a
test tool. It then boots an Android emulator with the app, enrolls it,
registers a tool inside the emulator, and checks that each side discovers
the other's tool through the mesh.

The app's privacy policy, for the store listing, is at
[/docs/privacy/](../../privacy/).
